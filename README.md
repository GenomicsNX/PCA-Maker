PCA Maker
================

A R Shiny app to make and deploy principal component analysis from TSV and CSV files.

You can use PCAMaker through two options:

#### 1

Simply download it from this GitHub page or through GitHub Desktop. Once in the HeatmapMaker main directory, just double click the .Rproj file and type in the R console (you need devtools package):

`devtools::laod_all(".")`

and then:

`PCAMaker()`

#### 2

Install the app as a package with the next code:

`devtools::install_github("jpch26/PCA-Maker")`

then:

`library(PCAMaker)`

and finally:

`PCAMaker()`  

To do the above, you can also run the file app.R within PCAMaker main directory.
